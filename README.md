# A discord bot made with JavaScript and the discord.js library

### Installing the dependencies
``` npm i```

### Usage
Make a config.json file in the root directory of the project and add:
``` 
{
  "prefix": "!",  // You can change the prefix to whatever you want it doesn't have to be - !
  "token": "Your-Bot-Token",
  "tenorAPI": "tenor-API-key",
  "newsAPI": "news-api-key",
  "youtubeAPI": "youtube-api-key"
}
```
I run the bot on a debian 9 environment so it might not work as intended on other operating systems, if you need a guide on how to install node.js on debian 9 or ubuntu I will link one in the resources down below. Moreover, the music command is still under development, so it might break.
